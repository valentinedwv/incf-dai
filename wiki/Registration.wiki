#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

This page describes the use of ITK and ANTS commands in order to perform

* Image Reconstruction
* Image Registration


= Image Reconstruction =

Image reconstruction is the process by which N 2D images are composed into a consisten 3D volumetric datase

== Example Command 1 ==

   SimpleImageReconstruction  "inputImage%03d.png"   1   31  0.55   0.55   1.50          yuko_A.nii.gz

This command will take as input a collection of 31 images with names

 * inputImage001.png
 * inputImage002.png
 * inputImage003.png
 * ...
 * inputImage031.png

and will compose with them a Nifti image, compressed containing a volumetric dataset, that will be saved in a file with name

 * yuko_A.nii.gz

The values

 * 0.55
 * 0.55
 * 1.50

are the pixel size values in microns(? or millimeters) along X, Y and Z, respectively


== Print Information Command ==

This command prints out some basic information from the header of a Nifti file.

=== Example ===


PrintImageInformation  yuko_A.nii.gz

and it will print out information such as


 File = yuko_A.nii.gz
 Origin = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
 Spacing = [0.55, 0.55, 1.50]
 Size = [512, 1024, 31]
 Direction =  
 -1 0 0
 0 -1 0
 0 0 1


= Image Registration =

Image registration is the process by which we compute the coordinate transformation between two input 3D volumetric images.


A typical example, will be to register the 3D image acquired in a recent experiment, to one of the atlas images of the Waxholm space. For example


 * canon_hist.nii.gz
 * canon_T1_r.nii.gz
 * canon_T2star_r.nii.gz
 * canon_T2W_r.nii.gz

In this particular case, we could register the following two images

 * yuko_A.nii.gz
 * canon_T1_r.nii.gz


In order to perform this registration we can use the ANTS application, that is built on top of ITK.  The typical ANTS command will look like this:


  ANTS 3 -m MI[cannon_T1-r.nii.gz,yuko_A.nii.gz,1,32] -o TEST -i 0 --rigid-affine true


 * ANTS is the executable file of the Advanced Normalization Tools
 * 3 is the dimension of the images that we are registering
 * MI indicates that we are using Mutual Information (comparison metric).
 * cannon_T1-r.nii.gz   is the reference images
 * yuko_A.nii.gz is the image to be registered to the reference.
 * --rigid-affine  request to compute a Rigid registration followed by an Affine registration
