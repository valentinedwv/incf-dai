/**
 * The <code>CRSProvider</code> will allow the support for different crs-definitions formats within the crs package. All
 * implementation should consider the fact that the deegree-crs package will assume all incoming and outgoing
 * latitude/longitude coordinates in <u>radians</u>. Dependent on the forceXY flag it is possible to set the axis order
 * to x/y (EAST/NORTH; WEST/SOUTH). If this flag is true and the defined axis order is not x/y, the axis order will be
 * swapped. By default the defined axis order will be used.
