/**
 * Provides access to the results of a {@link Query} operation.
 * <p>
 * The primary means of accessing the individual result features is to use the {@link #iterator()} method and
 * subsequently call it's {@link Iterator#next()} methods. Depending on the implementation (e.g. when backed by an SQL
 * result set), this enables the processing of arbitrary large numbers of results without causing memory issues. Also,
 * it's essential to ensure that the {@link #close()} method is called afterwards, or resource leaks may occur (e.g.
 * open SQL result sets).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A typical use of a {@link FeatureResultSet} looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *   ...
 *   FeatureResultSet rs = null;
 *    try {
 *        // retrieve the FeatureResultSet
 *        rs = ...
 *        for ( Feature f : rs ) {
 *            // do something with the feature
 *            // ...
 *        }
 *    } finally {
 *        // make sure that the FeatureResultSet always gets closed
 *        if ( rs != null ) {
 *            rs.close();
 *        }
 *    }
 *    ...
 * </pre>
 *
