=How To Create a Hub=

  # Have some data to offer.
  # Have a desire to follow INCF [http://code.google.com/p/incf-dai/wiki/AtlasRequestInterfaceSpec Atlas Interface Specification] which is based on the OGC WPS standard. This describes the client-server _contract_ in terms of requests from a client to the hub and responses from the hub to a client.
  # Review the [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0Af-22shvZFIQZGQ5eDk3d2tfMmRyaGhqNmZw&hl=en INCF Atlas Hub Specification and INCF Atlasing Infrastructure Overview] which describes INCF Atlas rpoject.
  # Determine what coordinate system you would like to use.
  # Learn and use the WAxML schema, or SRS (spacial reference system), for XML responses to a client.
  # Use the atlas-common code. This is optional, but this library, or hub building toolkit, is used by the INCF Atlas development team at UCSD. It includes code that is common across multiple hubs such as standard SRS transformations and exception reporting.
  # Implement the requests GetCapabilities and DescribeProcess. These standard WPS request describes the Execute requests methods offered by the hub and allow a hub to be cataloged.
  # Examine the [http://code.google.com/p/incf-dai/wiki/AtlasFunctionHubApplicabilityTable  Atlas Function-Hub Applicability Table].
  # Select the functions you wish to offer at your hub.
  
  # Review section 6 of the [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0Af-22shvZFIQZGQ5eDk3d2tfMmRyaGhqNmZw&hl=en INCF Atlas Hub Specification and INCF Atlasing Infrastructure Overview].
