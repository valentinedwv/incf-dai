This page describes the use of ITK and ANTS commands in order to perform

* Image Reconstruction
* Image Registration


= Image Reconstruction =

Image reconstruction is the process by which N 2D images are composed into a consisten 3D volumetric datase

== Example Command 1 ==

   SimpleImageReconstruction  "inputImage%03d.png"   1   31  0.55   0.55   1.50          yuko_A.nii.gz

This command will take as input a collection of 31 images with names

 * inputImage001.png
 * inputImage002.png
 * inputImage003.png
 * ...
 * inputImage031.png

and will compose with them a Nifti image, compressed containing a volumetric dataset, that will be saved in a file with name

 * yuko_A.nii.gz

The values

 * 0.55
 * 0.55
 * 1.50

are the pixel size values in microns(? or millimeters) along X, Y and Z, respectively


== Print Information Command ==

This command prints out some basic information from the header of a Nifti file.

=== Example ===


PrintImageInformation  yuko_A.nii.gz

and it will print out information such as


File = yuko_A.nii.gz
Origin = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
Spacing = [0.55, 0.55, 1.50]
Size = [512, 1024, 31]
Direction = 
-1 0 0
0 -1 0
0 0 1
