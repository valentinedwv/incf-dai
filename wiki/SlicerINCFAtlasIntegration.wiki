=Introduction=
Project notes for integrating Slice and INCF Atlas Hubs.

=Purpose=
To integrate Slicer with INCF Atlas Hubs.

=Workflow=
 * User opens Slicer
 * User loads data
   * Such as canon_T1_r.nii
   * Use "Add Data" from toolbar (icon "DATA" on left)
   * SRS is Mouse_WHS_1.0
 * User places fiducial POI
   * Load Annotations module
   * Use Fiducial on toolbar to create one or more POIs (points of interest)
   * Fiducial will be chosen coordinates
   * Enter a Name for the POI fiducial
 * User loads "Dave Extension" module
 * Module presents
   * Selection list of scene "Points of Interest" (fiducials)
   * Or, message that there are no fiducials, please add one or more
   * Button "Get 2D Images at POI"
 * User selects POI from drop-down list of POIs (fiducials)
 * User presses button "Get 2D Images by POI"
 * Module acquires list of images using DAI Get2DImagesByPOI
   * At selected POI defaulting to filter=maptype:sagittal and tolerance=3
   * Extracts list "ImageSource" element text strings from response
   * Extracts LAYERS values from each ImageSource text string
 * Module presents
   * Selection list of LAYERS values "Available Images at POI"
     * Or message "No images returned" (TODO)
   * Button "Get Selected Image"
 * User presses button "Get Selected Image"
 * Module integrates image into scene (TODO)
   
=Coordinate Transformations=
==Mouse_WHS_1.0 to/from Mouse_WHS_0.9==
 * pixelsPerMM = 46.512
 * x10min =  -5.3965
 * y10min = -11.997
 * z10min =  -5.5255
===0.9 to 1.0===
 * x10 = (x09 / pixelsPerMM) - x10min
 * y10 = (y09 / pixelsPerMM) - y10min
 * z10 = (z09 / pixelsPerMM) - z10min
===1.0 to 0.9===
 * x09 = (x10 - x10min) * pixelsPerMM
 * y09 = (y10 - y10min) * pixelsPerMM
 * z09 = (z10 - z10min) * pixelsPerMM

=INCF Altas Hubs as Seen from Slicer=
 * Atlas hubs are "fronts" for accessing data from a variety of atlas data sources
 * Atlas data sources currently include 
   * ABA (Allen Brain Atlas from the Allen Brain Institute)
   * EMAP (Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project)
   * WHS ()
   * UCSD (Cell-Centered Database (CCDB) at the University of California, San Diego)
 * INCF Atlas Hubs provide a uniform interface for requesting atlas data from the corresponding atlas data sourcehttp://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.1/Developers
 * The Hubs do not return actual atlas data directly
 * A client application, such as Slicer, can use the common INCF Atlas Hub interface to get references (links and metadata) to actual atlas source data

=Questions Regarding the Scope of Integration=
 # Are we adding a capability to Slicer to import data via INCF Atlas Hubs? E.g. accessing these INCF processes:
   * DescribeSRS
   * !DescribeTransformation
   * Get2DImagesByPOI
   * GetAnnotationsByPOI
   * GetCorrelationsByPOI
   * GetGenesByPOI
   * !GetGenesByGeneId
   * GetObjectsByPOI
   * GetStructureNamesByPOI
   * !GetTransformationChain
   * ListSRSs 
   * !ListTransformations 
   * Retrieve2DImages, 
 # Are we adding a capability to Slicer to export data to INCF Atlas? This would be the like
   * !SetAnnotations
 # Are we adding a capability to Slicer to use an INCF Atlas tool? This would be like
   * TransformPOI
 # Are we expecting to add anything to INCF Atlas processes that would interact with Slicer (from the INCF Atlas end)? (I'm assuming NO.)

=Scheme for Slicer as an INCF Atlas Client=
Note: For the time being, I'm ignoring the INCF Atlas Central Hub and the WPS !GetCapabilities and !DescribePorcesses functions.
 * A Slicer user in a Slicer session may submit an HTTP GET request to an INCF Atlas Hub
 * The hub will return an XML document (typically containing a link or a list of links and some metadata relating to the links)
 * Slicer will parse the returned data and display the returned information
 * The Slicer user may select a link to pursue and Slicer will submit a corresponding HTTP GET request
 * Slicer will receive the requested data
 * ...

=Background=

==Jeff Grethe email of 9/5/12==

 * Primary Slicer site (http://www.slicer.org). This has all the background information on Slicer. 
 * There is a specific developer's page (http://www.slicer.org/pages/DeveloperOrientation) that also has information on how to build slider (http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.1/Developers/Build_Instructions) including information on how to access the code base via GIT or SVN.
 * One other application that has been integrated with Slicer that deals with retrieving data is XNAT (http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2012_Summer_Project_Week:XNATSlicerIntegration)
 * For the INCF atlasing services there is a page (http://atlasing.incf.org/wiki/Developers) for developers that links to other resources including an overview document (https://docs.google.com/View?id=dd9x97wk_2drhhj6fp)
