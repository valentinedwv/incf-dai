GetCapabilites and DescribeProcess Database
===========================================

Overview
--------
The "database" supporting the WPS GetCapabilities and DescribeProcess requests
consist of 3 files:

- Capabilities.xq (xq for XQuery)
- ProcessDescriptions.xq
- ProcessInputs.xml

The .xq files are "template" files of mostly XML but some embedded XQuery
statements. (A Google search for "XQJ tutorial" will lead you to several good
tutorials. XQJ is XQuery for Java.)

Capabilities.xq has the basic WPS GetCapabilities response static elements with
the XQuery statements that will dynamically insert the appropriate wps:Process
elements. These are retrieved from ProcessDescription.xq.

ProcessDescriptions.xq has the basic WPS DescribeProcess response to include
the Process Identifier, Title, and Abstract (also used in the GetCapabilities
response) and the ProcessOutput element. Each Process has zero to several
ProcessInputs which are drawn from the ProcessInputs.xml file via embedded 
XQuery statements.

ProcessInputs.xml contains the set of inputs used by the various processes
which are the WPS execute functions offered by the WPS server.

Editing the Database
--------------------
To make changes to the database (equivalent to SQL inserts, updates, and 
deletes), you merely edit the three files taking care to preserve their ability
to generate GetCapabilities and DescribeProcess XML responses that successfully
validate against the appropriate WPS response schema.

For example, if there are changes to Process DataInputs, edit the 
ProcessInput.xml. These will roll into the ProcessDescription elements via the
XQuery statements in ProcessDescriptions.xq.
