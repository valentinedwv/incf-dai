#summary This are the main registration workflow steps.

= Introduction =

From segmentation to packaged image stacks to 3D image reconstruction, to reconstruction quality measures, then registering to a fixed image (e.g. WHS) - initialization, then a finer transform - to passing the transform file along with the initial image to a warping compute system, to generating lookups (forward and inverse), atlas services, quality measures (e.g. via simulations)


= Details =

* 1. Segmentation: is a one-off step, so not covered here, however ITK may provide some scripts that make segmentation easier. 

* 2. Initial package, in single modality. The slices are segmented but don't have consistent spacing or mutual alignment. This package includes a) collection of individual images, b) collection of downsampled images, c) metadata XML. The metadata XML may look like:

<Slices modality=”delineation|MRI|NISSL|…” device="microscope" resolution = "0.001" units=”mm” alignment="no">
  <Slice code="01" constant="1.1" yOrientation="AA" xOrientation="BB" slicetype="oblique" thumbnail="filename">image_name</Slice>
</Slices>
<orientations>
//  this is as in DescribeSRS
//  AA: ax+by+cz (where a,b,c = anterior-posterior;ventral-dorsal;left-right)
</orientations>

* 3. Interpolator: processes the initial package, to generate a new package where slices are at equal spacing:

<Slices modality=”delineation|MRI|NISSL|…” device="microscope" resolution = "0.001" units=”mm” spacing="0.12" alignment="no">
  <Slice code="01" yOrientation="AA" xOrientation="BB" yOrientation="oblique" thumbnail="filename">image_name</slice>
</Slices>

* 4. Alignment: takes the correctly spaced package, and shifts/affine transforms plates into alignment. The origin is also set at this step, either by the user, or automatically (?)

<Slices modality=”delineation|MRI|NISSL|…” device="microscope" resolution = "0.001" units=”mm” spacing="0.12" alignment="yes" origin="  ">
  <Slice code="01" yOrientation="AA" xOrientation="BB" yOrientation="oblique" thumbnail="filename">image_name</slice>
</Slices>

* 5. 3Dreconstruction. This step takes the clean package (with consistent spacing, alignment, and origin set), and generates a nifti. The information in the package file shall be sufficient to generate coordinate system description in nifti.

* 6. Quality measures of the 3D reconstruction. These are automatically generated. Based on them, user may return to steps 3-4-5.
