 * Primary Slicer site (http://www.slicer.org). This has all the background information on Slicer. 
 * There is a specific developer's page (http://www.slicer.org/pages/DeveloperOrientation) that also has information on how to build slider (http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.1/Developers/Build_Instructions) including information on how to access the code base via GIT or SVN.

 * One other application that has been integrated with Slicer that deals with retrieving data is XNAT (http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2012_Summer_Project_Week:XNATSlicerIntegration)

 * For the INCF atlasing services there is a page (http://atlasing.incf.org/wiki/Developers) for developers that links to other resources including an overview document (https://docs.google.com/View?id=dd9x97wk_2drhhj6fp)
